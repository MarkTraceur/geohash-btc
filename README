This script will generate a link to a google map, the point on which is the Geohash location for today, based on Bitcoin trading prices instead of the DJIA.

Feel free to use it any way you like, and hack on it even, this one is just for fun!

Also, let me know if you want to join me on adventures!

Yours geekily,
